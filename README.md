# Where in the World...?

## Interactive Frontend Milestone Project

<hr>

Welcome to *Where in the World...?*

This is a simple game written in JavaScript that makes use of the Google Maps API. This single page website is intended to showcase basic JavaScript and provide an entertaining few minutes for the user.

The goal was to produce a game that would:

1. entertain the user while testing their knowledge of various world cities
2. use the Google Maps API in a seamless and fully integrated fashion
3. show the user some famous tourist spots in major world cities and some more unknown spots in others
4. give the user a chance to play in hard or easy modes, depending on their choice
5. need only a single page and no browser refreshes or use of forward/back buttons; so if the user wants to restart the game they can do so without ever leaving the page

## User Experience

### Strategy

The app is deliberately simplistic in layout and presentation. This is to ensure that anyone from anywhere in the world can play and also helps the page remain responsive to the user's inputs.

### Scope

The website exists primarily as a milestone project for the Code Institute diploma, but also as something that can provide a diverting five minutes for an interested player. It's nice to feel like you're *kind of* going away during lockdown!

### Structure

The page is deliberately simple - on the page loading the welcome modal pops up and gives the user the instructions. On beginning the game, the map and pictures load, the countdown begins and it's game on!

### Skeleton

The wireframe for the app was done in Balsamiq and there are some subtle differences between the sketches and the finished app:

1. Pre-game wireframe

2. In-game wireframe

3. Post-game wireframe

### Surface

The minimalist design is complemented with simple colour schemes and layout.

## Curent Features

1. Welcome modal that shows the player how to play the game
2. Google Maps API integration to display locations
3. Images dynamically loaded to the page
4. Two different difficulty levels, each with different scoring 
5. A countdown timer to impose a time limit on the game
6. A game over modal that shows the player their score and allows them to go again

## Future Features

1. A larger array of places for the player to be shown
2. Different playing modes based around continents - for example, a mode on major European cities
3. A progressive level of difficulty that increases the toughness as each playthrough goes on

## Deployment

This project was deployed on Github Pages by going to the Github repository settings, scrolling to the Github Pages section, selecting the "master branch" from the source dropdown menu and then letting the page automatically refresh.

The link to the live site then became visible and it will update if any changes are made on the master branch of the repository.
