# Where in the World...?

## Interactive Frontend Milestone Project

<hr>

Welcome to *Where in the World...?*

This is a simple game written in JavaScript that makes use of the Google Maps API. This single page website is intended to showcase basic JavaScript and provide an entertaining few minutes for the user.

The goal was to produce a game that would:

1. entertain the user while testing their knowledge of various world cities
2. use the Google Maps API in a seamless and fully integrated fashion
3. show the user some famous tourist spots in major world cities and some more unknown spots in others
4. give the user a chance to play in hard or easy modes, depending on their choice
5. need only a single page and no browser refreshes or use of forward/back buttons; so if the user wants to restart the game they can do so without ever leaving the page

## User Experience

### Strategy

The app is deliberately simplistic in layout and presentation. This is to ensure that anyone from anywhere in the world can play and also helps the page remain responsive to the user's inputs.

### Scope

The website exists primarily as a milestone project for the Code Institute diploma, but also as something that can provide a diverting five minutes for an interested player. It's nice to feel like you're *kind of* going away during lockdown!

### Structure

The page is deliberately simple - on the page loading the welcome modal pops up and gives the user the instructions. On beginning the game, the map and pictures load, the countdown begins and it's game on!

### Skeleton

The wireframe for the app was done in Balsamiq:
